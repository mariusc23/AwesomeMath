    <td><p>Questions of maxima and minima have great  practical significance, with applications to physics, engineering, and  economics; they have also given rise to theoretical advances, notably  in calculus and optimization. Indeed, while most texts view the study  of extrema within the context of calculus, this carefully constructed  problem book takes a uniquely intuitive approach to the subject: it  presents hundreds of extreme value problems, examples, and solutions  primarily through Euclidean geometry.</p>
      <p>Key features and topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive selection of problems, including Greek geometry and  optics, Newtonian mechanics, isoperimetric problems, and&nbsp;recently  solved problems&nbsp;such as Malfatti&rsquo;s problem </li>
        <li>Unified approach to the subject, with emphasis on geometric, algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial reasoning</li>
        <li>Presentation and application of classical inequalities, including  Cauchy--Schwarz and Minkowski&rsquo;s Inequality; basic results in calculus,  such as the Intermediate Value Theorem; and emphasis on simple but  useful geometric concepts, including transformations, convexity, and  symmetry </li>
        <li>Clear solutions to the problems, often accompanied by figures</li>
        <li>Hundreds of exercises of varying difficulty, from straightforward to Olympiad-caliber</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Written by a team of established mathematicians and professors, this  work draws on the authors&rsquo; experience in the classroom and as Olympiad  coaches. By exposing readers to a wealth of creative problem-solving  approaches, the text communicates not only geometry but also algebra,  calculus, and topology. Ideal for use at the junior and senior  undergraduate level, as well as&nbsp;in enrichment programs and Olympiad  training for advanced high school students, this book&rsquo;s breadth and  depth will appeal to a wide audience, from secondary school teachers  and pupils to graduate students, professional mathematicians, and  puzzle enthusiasts.<br />

    <td><p><em>103 Trigonometry Problems</em> contains carefully-selected problems and solutions used in the training and testing of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. Though many problems may initially appear impenetrable to the novice, most can be solved using only elementary high school mathematics techniques. </p>
      <p>Key features: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Gradual progression in problem difficulty builds and strengthens mathematical skills and techniques </li>
        <li>Basic topics include trigonometric formulas and identities, their applications in the geometry of the triangle, trigonometric equations and inequalities, and substitutions involving trigonometric functions</li>
        <li>Problem-solving tactics and strategies, along with practical test-taking techniques, provide in-depth enrichment and preparation for possible participation in various mathematical competitions</li>
        <li>Comprehensive introduction (first chapter) to trigonometric functions, their relations and functional properties, and their applications in the Euclidean plane and solid geometry expose advanced students to college level material</li>
      </ul>
      <p>103 Trigonometry Problems is a cogent problem-solving resource for advanced high school students, undergraduates, and mathematics teachers engaged in competition training.</p>
