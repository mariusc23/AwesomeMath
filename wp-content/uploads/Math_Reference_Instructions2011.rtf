\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
The student who has asked you for a reference letter is applying to the AwesomeMath Summer Program 2011. In order to get a complete picture of the student, we ask the student to take a qualifying exam and to solicit two reference letters: one from a mathematics teacher or mentor and one from someone who is familiar with the student\'92s activities and accomplishments outside the world of mathematics. All information you provide will be held in confidence and disclosed only to the Admissions Committee. For more information about the application process or the program, visit our website at \cf2 \ul \ulc2 http://www.awesomemath.org/\cf0 \ulnone .\
\
We ask that you address the following prompts:\

What are the first three words that come to mind when describing this student?\
Please comment on the student\'92s character, citizenship, and contributions to your community.\
